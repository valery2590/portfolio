                        After 4 years in University, I got my Tourism Degree in Barcelona, this fact helped me to work in several different companies 
                        until I achieved the Senior Customer Care Manager position.</p>

                    I have created tools to improve my daily work. So, last year I decided to push this love for code, I entered a 5 months Full-Stack Bootcamp since I wanted to be a programmer. Here I am now.
                    Someone who has the courage to change their carreer,
