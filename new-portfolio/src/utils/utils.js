    <b>Hello! Welcome to my story.</b> Here comes a sum up of my life. Born in
    Perú 🇵🇪, raised in Barcelona 🇪🇸 and I have been living in several places:
    London 🇬🇧, Derry 🇮🇪, Turku 🇫🇮, Colombo 🇱🇰, Tenerife 🇪🇸, Padova 🇮🇹 ... <br />
    <br />
    I studied Tourism in university, so I know how to handle clients and also I
    am able to speak in English 👌🏽, Italian 🤌🏽 and Spanish ✌🏽
    <br />
    <br />
    I found the programming world at some job because I created some tools.
    After that, I fall in love instantly...❤️
    <br />
    <br />
    So I have ended doing a full stack developer course and finally, I found a
    tech job and some projects. 🧑🏽‍💻

    After a few years, currently I am Solutions Developer. I was lucky to find a
    job which I learnt a lot. Also, I have created some tools and helped
    different departments. <br />
    <br />
    However, nowadays, I am able to create integrations in order to connect
    applications. Furthermore, I am dealing with client's requests.
    <br />
    <br />
    As a good student, I am all the time studying and improving my code. Just to
    face new challanges with a good preparation.
